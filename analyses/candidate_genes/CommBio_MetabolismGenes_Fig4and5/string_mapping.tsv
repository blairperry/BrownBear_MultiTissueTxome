Essential for the SPATA13-mediated [...] 
69	SDHA	9606.ENSP00000264932	SDHA	Succinate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein subunit, mitochondrial; Flavoprotein (FP) subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) that is involved in complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and is responsible for transferring electrons from succinate to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q). Can act as a tumor suppressor; Belongs to the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase 2 family. FRD/SDH subfamily
70	SLC16A1	9606.ENSP00000441065	SLC16A1	Monocarboxylate transporter 1; Proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter. Catalyzes the rapid transport across the plasma membrane of many monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, branched-chain oxo acids derived from leucine, valine and isoleucine, and the ketone bodies acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetate. Depending on the tissue and on cicumstances, mediates the import or export of lactic acid and ketone bodies. Required for normal nutrient assimilation, increase of white adipose tissue and body weight gain when on a high-fat diet. Plays a role in cellular responses to [...] 
71	SLC25A1	9606.ENSP00000215882	SLC25A1	Tricarboxylate transport protein, mitochondrial; Involved in citrate-H(+)/malate exchange. Important for the bioenergetics of hepatic cells as it provides a carbon source for fatty acid and sterol biosyntheses, and NAD(+) for the glycolytic pathway; Solute carriers
72	SREBF1	9606.ENSP00000348069	SREBF1	Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1; Transcriptional activator required for lipid homeostasis. Regulates transcription of the LDL receptor gene as well as the fatty acid and to a lesser degree the cholesterol synthesis pathway (By similarity). Binds to the sterol regulatory element 1 (SRE-1) (5'-ATCACCCCAC-3'). Has dual sequence specificity binding to both an E-box motif (5'-ATCACGTGA-3') and to SRE-1 (5'-ATCACCCCAC-3'); Basic helix-loop-helix proteins
73	TBC1D1	9606.ENSP00000261439	TBC1D1	TBC1 domain family member 1; May act as a GTPase-activating protein for Rab family protein(s). May play a role in the cell cycle and differentiation of various tissues. Involved in the trafficking and translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into cells (By similarity)
74	TBC1D4	9606.ENSP00000366863	TBC1D4	TBC1 domain family member 4; May act as a GTPase-activating protein for RAB2A, RAB8A, RAB10 and RAB14. Isoform 2 promotes insulin-induced glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 translocation at the plasma membrane, thus increasing glucose uptake
75	TRAF3	9606.ENSP00000454207	TRAF3	TNF receptor-associated factor 3; Regulates pathways leading to the activation of NF- kappa-B and MAP kinases, and plays a central role in the regulation of B-cell survival. Part of signaling pathways leading to the production of cytokines and interferon. Required for normal antibody isotype switching from IgM to IgG. Plays a role T-cell dependent immune responses. Plays a role in the regulation of antiviral responses. Is an essential constituent of several E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes. May have E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and promote 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of [...] 
76	YWHAG	9606.ENSP00000306330	YWHAG	14-3-3 protein gamma; Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner; Belongs to the 14-3-3 family
